Project is archived, because I switched to [NixVim](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/index.html) to manage my NeoVim config.

# NeoVim Configuation

This is my personal [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. It is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/munsman/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
